# Insurance-Data-Analysis-and-Forecasting

This project demonstrates the process of analyzing and forecasting insurance-related data using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features such as customer details, vehicle prices, insurance claims, and more. The goal of this project is to forecast financial data, predict risk, and identify ideal customer profiles (ICP) using clustering.

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning algorithms for financial forecasting, risk forecasting, and customer segmentation. Using a combination of regression models, clustering, and time-series forecasting, it aims to:

- Forecast customer financial data (car prices).
- Predict risk related to insurance claims.
- Identify customer segments (ICP) for targeted marketing.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.
```

## Steps Involved
- Data Collection: Import and load the insurance dataset.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand the data.
- Modeling: Train different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and KMeans Clustering.
- Evaluation: Assess the models' performance using various metrics.
